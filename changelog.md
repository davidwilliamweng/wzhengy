- Good to see some progress.

# Week 7, Monday 15/April [Henry]
- Progress missing of late. I see to be logging into your repo more than each of you are.. which shouldn't be the case :) [Henry]
- Your readme needs fixing. The formatting is odd (look at it in github to render the markdown). And it doesn't say your names/SIDs, and other info we need to know who's project this is.
