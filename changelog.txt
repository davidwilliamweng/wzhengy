I do NOT understand your code structure. There's a directory (week4) that's outside your src/ directory. How is this to run? --- Explain everything in your readme on how to run this code, and all directory structures for the source code of the app
Not enough updates to pass. At this stage, you have not been meeting the minimum work (two days per week) to pass.
If you are going to withdraw from the unit, please do so ASAP. It is unlikely you can pass anymore.
